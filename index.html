					<p class="about_description">Hello, my name is John Lee and I am a undergraduate senior at Stony Brook University studying Information Systems with a specialization in System and Network Administration. My interest and passion in all things technology has brought me to where I am today, but also motivates me to never stop learning.  
     				Studying at Stony Brook University has not only broadened the scope of my field, but reinforced my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Java, and Python, etc. </p>

I had formed a team, which consisted of two other members in order to build a website related to the CDC (Center of Disease Control). The purpose of our website was to provide a heat map of differnt types of diseases within the 50 different states of the United States of America. This experience was very important to me, because it helped teach me the importance of teamwork in a group setting. We worked towards the same goal and helped each other out during the entire process.</p></div>

This event was hosted by Softeon and help at the Wang center on Stony Brook main campus, and revolved around networking. I was given the opportunity to meet many different types of people within Softeon and also talk to recent graduates who were now employed in the field. This experience allowed me to broaden my network and also learn more about the industy. However, I think the best takeway was that I was able to more confidently convey my knowledge to professionals and built invaluable networking skills.</p></div>

				<div class="project_content">
					<p class="project_description">This is a picture of my RDM in MySQL for my ISE305 class project. The goal for the project was to create and design our own data base. For the project we chose to center the data base around a made up travel agency and have our data base handle all of the entries that might be involved with that scenario.</p>

					<p class="project_description">Asol.gg is a website I made with 2 other friends based on the popular online video game "League Of Legends". The main purpose of the website was to be able to look up different players in the game with the provided search bar. The secondary purpose of the website was to provide general information about the game, such as champion and item information.</p>

			<div class="memory_project"><img src="images/memory.PNG" alt="Photo of the memory game" class="memory_photo">
				<div class="project_content">
					<p class="project_description">This is a memory based card game that I built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while I was at Mindweaver. The goal of the game is to find two matching cards within the same turn in order to register it as a point. If this is accomplished, the cards would disappear from the game board and a point would be assigned to the player. If not, the non-matching cards would turn back over and your turn would end. This small project taught me how to incorporate certain techniques accomplish this, and I have since used those skills to further improve my others works.</p>
